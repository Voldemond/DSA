  Data Structures
In this section, you will find implementations of the following data structures:

1.Array
2.Linked List
3.Stack
4.Queue
5.Binary Tree
6.Heap
7.Hash Table
8.Graph
9.and more...
Each data structure is implemented in its own Java class file, along with relevant methods and operations. The implementations are organized in a modular and easy-to-understand manner.

Algorithms
In this section, you will find implementations of various algorithms, including:

Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
Searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
Graph algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
Dynamic Programming algorithms
Recursion algorithms
and more...
The algorithms are implemented in separate Java classes, and each implementation includes a brief explanation of the algorithm's approach and complexity analysis.

How to Use
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Voldemond/DSA.git
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

Navigate to the desired data structure or algorithm implementation.

Explore the code and comments to understand the implementation and usage.

Modify the code as needed or use it as a reference for your own projects.
